# Iteration 1 Note

- Late found issue where the list of children to be chosen to pick always excluded the child thart picked last time. 
This means that one child can never pick twice in a row (hardcoded). This probably needs to be changed for the next iteration. 

- We found an aestheic we liked for the app quite late and had only applied it fully to the Timer portion of the app. 
The plan was to add blue-pink gradient backgrounds for all screens to replace the white.
