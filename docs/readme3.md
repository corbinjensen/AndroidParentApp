# Iteration 3 Note

- The **Help** screen is now scrollable on small screens
- The **Take Breath** feature is now called **Zen**, which is found under the **Calm** screen with the **Timeout** feature
- After finishing the breathing exercise, users can either start a new exercise or return to the **Calm** menu
- When deleting a child, any references of that child (the coinflip result, the task history record, the icon photo) also get deleted
- When deleting a task, all the history of that task also gets deleted
